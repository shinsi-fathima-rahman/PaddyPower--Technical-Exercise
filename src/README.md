 -This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
 
 Few things to note :
 
 -I have added comments as to what I would have like to do , if i had more time.
 
 -I am currently undergoing training at my current company, so I did not have time to finish writing unit test cases for all components.
 
 -I have attached the package.json (contains all dependencies); I have used React-Bootstrap and React-icons additionally.

 -I am not exactly sure whether the matches within a group were not played, or if the data simply does not exist. I have assumed that the data does not exist (Please check SuperLiga - 2016/2017)
 
 -I still wasn't sure about how the various groups, phases should have been displayed.Due to time crunch, I have displayed tables for each phase and groups.
 	If I had more time, ideally I would have created multiple tabs, each showing individual phase/group teams.
